    <h2>Overview:</h2>
     <p> Achieving alignment on the goal of the workshop is a critical first step. This should be completed prior to the workshop. However, you can use the first few minutes of a workshop to achieve a
       shared reality about the purpose. You should read the goal statement to the participants to ensure that there is alignment.
       By defining the goal at the very start,
       the team will understand the purpose and be able to make changes to the goal as needed. The goal should be (1) actionable, (2) should not be a solution, and (3) should identify a customer. </p>
